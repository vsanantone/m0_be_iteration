# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
It can iterate through the whole array when looking for something specific like in a phone book or roster.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I would like to learn more methods and practice the ones I have come across.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
I asked for help via google, phone a friend/sister and or classmates. I have much to learn.
